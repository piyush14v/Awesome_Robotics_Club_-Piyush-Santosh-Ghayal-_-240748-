From start i had interest in robotics and wanted to explore it and gain knowledge and this is the best opportunity, the motivation behind choosing the specific project is i would get to learn about
ROS (robot operating system) and path planning ,I have heard of this terms and wanted to understand it in deep like how ROS nodes, topics, and packages work together to control a robot, Learn to plan paths, 
avoid obstacles, and send goal commands for fully autonomous movement. this project would give me a practical experience as till now I get to learn only theory.
In this project I will devote myself as much as possible and try to learn , as in the task only i got an idea of how much efforts we have to put to gain experience to do the task i get to learn many new things,
watched new topics tutorial gets information from books and many more that i did't expected but after it has done , it had increased my curiosity to do the project and I think we are going to get the one of the
best experience this summers ðŸ˜Š.
