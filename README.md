The project employs Dijkstra's path algorithm on a 2D grid where each cell is assigned varying terrain and a movement cost. The grid has characters such as 'S' (start), 'G' (end), '.' (standard tile), '~' (water), '^' (mountain), and '#' (obstacle) which are all assigned a cost, the obstacles not being passable. The algorithm operates with the grid as a weighted graph, using a priority queue to explore along shortest-cost paths first. It uses a distance matrix to store the minimum cost to get to each cell and a previous node map to backtrack when it reaches the goal. At each move, it searches the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and, in case it observes a cheaper route, it costs and continues exploring. Once the goal is fulfilled, the way back is restored from the end to the start following the previously stored node details. This method ensures that the shortest path is computed with consideration given to different costs across terrain, and is very ideal for such usage as robot navigation, computer games maps, or delivery routing where traversal within intricate environments has to be optimized.
